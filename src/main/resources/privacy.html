    Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as TOS or ToS, ToU or T&C)
    <br> the legal agreements between a service provider and a person who wants to use that service. The person must agree
    <br> to abide by the terms of service in order to use the offered service.[1] Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer,
    <br> especially regarding the use of websites. Vague language and lengthy sentences used in the terms of use have brought
    <br> on customer privacy and raised public awareness in many ways.
    <br>A terms of service agreement typically contains sections pertaining to one or more of the following topic:

    Disambiguation/definition of key words and phrases
    User rights and responsibilities
    Proper or expected usage; definition of misuse
    Accountability for online actions, behavior, and conduct
    Privacy policy outlining the use of personal data
    Payment details such as membership or subscription fees, etc.
    Opt-out policy describing procedure for account termination, if available
    Sometimes contains a Arbitration clause detailing the dispute resolution process and limited rights to take a claim to court
    Disclaimer/Limitation of Liability clarifying the site's legal liability for damages incurred by users
    User notification upon modification of terms, if offered
    <br>Among 102 companies marketing genetic testing to consumers in 2014 for health purposes, 71 had publicly available terms and conditions:[4]

    57 of the 71 had disclaimer clauses (including 10 disclaiming liability for injury caused by their own negligence)
    51 let the company change terms (including 17 without notice)
    34 allow data disclosure in certain circumstances
    31 require consumers to indemnify the company
    20 promise not to sell data
    <br>Among 260 mass market consumer software license agreements in 2010:[5]

    91% disclaimed warranties of merchantability or fitness for purpose or said it was "As is"
    92% disclaimed consequential, incidental, special or foreseeable damages
    69% did not warrant the software was free of defects or would work as described in the manual
    55% capped damages at the purchase price or less
    36% said they were not warranting whether it infringed others' intellectual property rights
    32% required arbitration or a specific court
    17% required the customer to pay legal bills of the maker (indemnify), but not vice versa
    Among the terms and conditions of 31 cloud-computing services in January-July 2010, operating in England:[6]
    <br>27 specified the law to be used (a US state or other country)
    most specify that consumers can claim against the company only in a particular city in that jurisdiction, though often the company can claim against the consumer anywhere
    some require claims to be brought within half a year to 2 years
    7 impose arbitration, all forbid illegal and objectionable conduct by the consumer
    13 can amend terms just by posting changes on their own website
    a majority disclaim responsibility for confidentiality or backups
    most promise to preserve data only briefly after terminating service
    few promise to delete data thoroughly when the customer leaves
    some monitor the customers' data to enforce their policies on use
    all disclaim warranties and almost all disclaim liability
    24 require the customer to indemnify them, a few indemnify the customer
    a few give credits for poor service, 15 promise "best efforts" and can suspend or stop any time
    <br>The researchers note that rules on location and time limits may be unenforceable for consumers in many jurisdictions with consumer protections, that acceptable use
    <br> are rarely enforced, that quick deletion is dangerous if a court later rules the termination wrongful, that local laws often require warranties
